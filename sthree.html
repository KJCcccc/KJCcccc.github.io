        <h3>inclass explore with touchdesigner_one</h3>
        <p>During the first class on this project, we were explore generation in touchdesigner. By clicking "1" on keyboard, 
            the image will be reset and start over the generation.</p>

        <h3>inclass explore with touchdesigner_two</h3>
        <p>During the second class on this project, we were further explore generation in touchdesigner by adding a audio-reactive  
            feature, which the round-donut form will bounced in respond to the music.</p>

        <h3>flowing generation_on screen</h3>
        <p>Based on the previous two exploration and the requirement of projecting the final piece onto the wall or other areas in the building,    
            I decided to create a flowing generation that transits from black and white noisy image to black and white more clear flowing image, and,
            at the end, become a flowing colored image. Meanwhlie, all images/generations were react in respond to the music.</p>

        <h3>flowing generation_projection_location_one</h3>
        <p>Initially, I decided to project the flowinig generation on a corner in the studio space. However, due to the physical condition, 
            the environment was not complete dark, which the projection is not clear enough and the flowing direction is circular rather than   
            flowing from up to down. In the meantime, I am not satisfied with the flowing transition by arrangement in circular order.</p>

        <h3>flowing generation_projection_location_two</h3>
        <p>Based on the previous exploration on projection, I decided to find another location that could better match with my requirement.
            I decided to move to room M4, which once the light closed, the room will immsered in full darkness. Meanwhile, I find a spot which allows
            better transition between each state of the flowing generation while create a visual illusion, which by the generation would look different 
            when it was viewed from different angles.</p>
