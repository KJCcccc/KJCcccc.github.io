        <h3>Simple Dicord Bot:</h3>
        <p>During the first class, I learn how to create a discord bot and have a simple conversation with the bot. First, awake my discord bot
           then the bot will answered and offered two buttons for me to click; by clicking each botton, the bot will respond differently.</p>

        <h3>Guessing Animal Dicord Bot:</h3>
        <p>During the second class, I learn more about creating discord bot, as well as the usage of decision trees. Under instructions and guides, I create
           a discord bot that can play a simple animal guessing game with me. After awake the bot, the bot will start asking question, begin with 'Is it a mammal.
           Then I may respond by clicking one of the three buttons (Yes/No/Maybe). Then the bot will ask another follow-up question to help it guess the animal 
           I thinking of. After two questions, the bot will make a guess. If it was right, then bingo. If not, I can click 'wrong' button to help the bot
           further development and learn more in other guesses.</p>

        <h3>Choose Dog Dicord Bot_1.0:</h3>
        <p>After the learning more about discord bot through the building of the two discord bots above, I decided to create a discord bot of my preference.
           I want to create a discord bot that can give user suggestions on what breeds of dog the user might like to get. The user can awake the bot by
           typing '!choose_dog', then the bot will ask user three questions. The first question is the color of the dog user may like, giving with the choices of
           Black, White or Brown. The second questioin is the size of the dog, giving with the choices of Small, Medium and Large. Lastly, the third question
           is the activity level of the dog, giving with the choices of Low, Medium, and High. The user will type in the answer for each question. After all 
           three questions have been answered, the bot will give out three dog breeds suggestion. However, some combination of color, size and activity level 
           might not have suggestion.

        <h3>Choose Dog Dicord Bot_2.0:</h3>
        <p>Based on the Choose Dog Discord Bot_1.0, I want to make the interaction more smooth and simple for the user. Instead of user typing in 
           their answers for each question, the user may click the buttons under each question as a way of answering the question.
